            <p id="afang">Afang Soup is soup is a soup rich in meats and vegetables and palm oil. If you are averse to palm oil then this soup may not be for you. <br Some people actually make this oil free but Noooo I can't make this soup oil free lol. The oil is the real deal in this recipe. I am sure the originators of this dish will agree with me ?. Oil compliments most vegetable soups like Afang and Edikang ikong. Having tasted Afang with oil.<br I doubt you can convince me to ditch the oil in this recipe.</p>

        <p id="rice">Coconut rice is a staple in most Nigerian homes. However, the way we make it differ from home to home. I have adapted my moms’ delicious recipe and as usual, I added my own spin by using the chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken.
