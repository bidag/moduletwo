        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all <em>start</em> at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at <em>first.</em></strong><br>
        There was a time when Einstein <em>couldn’t</em> count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to <em>learn</em> his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        <strong>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.</strong><br>
        <em>One foot</em> in front of the other. <em>One idea</em> on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet.</em>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <em>basic ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can <em>understand.</em><br>
        <em>Whoever</em> you are, <em>wherever</em> you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
